                Hey Mate! I hope you are doing well while reading this! <br></br>
                So today, July 27. I'm feeling kinda lazy yet motivated to do something meaningful (I'm sick of binge-watching :'D), well I guess,
                 learning about React.js will be just fine! there are a lot of resources out there, and It's something
                 that I may use in the upcoming years, so "WHY NOT ?".<br></br>
                Well, I'm someone who gets bored very easily so, in order to beat that boredom, so imma give myself 4 days 
                to learn the bascis, and in each day, I have to build at least one project. <br></br>
                I'll be sharing all the projects that I'll be building (may this hold me accountable) <br></br>
                UPDATE : well, It's August 03, I can say : "I DID IT!!"<br></br>
                Well, I kinda enjoyed the process, I learned alot of stuff (but still a noob), and I built some cool projects (I hate the design tho, but whatever, that wasn't the main goal). <br></br>
                Hmm, THAT'S IT.

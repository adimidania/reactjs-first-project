    `Mama always told me that I was too naive, Gave away my trust for pennies, I said don't you worry, didn't think that I'll be broken down and crying help me. Wrecked? Check. Heart? In debt. All you do is come around, just came here to collect. Wrecked? Check. Heart? In debt. Don't you know that I cried tears of gold for you? I sit here poor for you, collect my pennies and my dimes, that's why you love it when I cry. Platinum love for you, I'd give no less for you. Generosity is my enemy, so I'm broke and your heart's rich because of me. Know that this is my fault, gave a little too much, knew that this was gonna happen, but I'm not gonna lie, you can make me cry thousand times, I come on in back like : “what is going on with my head?”`,
    `I saw you dancing in a crowded room, you look so happy when I'm not with you, but then you saw me, caught you by surprise, a single teardrop falling from your eye! I don't know why I run away, I'll make you cry when I run away. Take me back 'cause I wanna stay, save your tears for another day, save your tears for another day. Met you once under a Pisces moon I kept my distance 'cause I know that you don't like when I'm with nobody else I couldn't help it, I put you through hell. I don't know why I run away, Oh, boy, I'll make you cry when I run away. Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay. save your tears for another I realize that it's much too late, and you deserve someone better.`,
    `I've been tryin' to call, I've been on my own for long enough, maybe you can show me how to love, maybe I'm going through withdrawals, you don't even have to do too much, you can turn me on with just a touch, baby I look around and Sin City's cold and empty. No one's around to judge me. I can't see clearly when you're gone. And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights. No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust (Hey, hey, hey). I'm running out of time 'cause I can see the sunlight up the sky, so I hit the road in overdrive, baby. oh The city's cold and empty (oh) No one's around to judge me (oh) I can't see clearly when you're gone And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust.`,
    `I can't move, I'm so paralyzed I can't explain why I'm terrified I'm so terrified Well, I don't wanna touch the sky no more I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down It's been way too long And I don't even wanna get high no more Just want it out of my life, out I wanna cut you outta my dreams 'Til I'm bleeding out 'Til I'm bleeding I wanna cut you outta my mind 'Til I'm bleeding out 'Til I'm bleeding I wanna cut you outta my dreams Whoa, I'm bleeding out Girl, I'm bleeding I wanna cut you outta my mind 'Cause I'm bleeding out Oh, I'm bleeding Girl, I'm bleeding I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore Need it anymore`,
    `We found each other I helped you out of a broken place You gave me comfort But falling for you was my mistake I put you on top, I put you on top I claimed you so proud and openly, And when times were rough, when times were rough I made sure I held you close to me So call out my name (call out my name) Call out my name when I kiss you so gently I want you to stay (I want you to stay) I want you to stay, even though you don't want me, Girl, why can't you wait?

    `Just in case my car goes off the highway Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you Just like you, like you There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you Just like you, like you It's strange the way the mind can wander, but also stop to gossip And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of Maybe you're out to find love, maybe you lost who you was Maybe you're just like me and feel the need to stay in your rut 'Cause if you left it, you might feel like you're no longer you It's so impressive, the way the mind can play with the truth It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes But still relate and feel the same so in a way, guess we do You ever think about what it would be like If the clouds were gone and you could see light? If the door was open would you take flight Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?`,

    `And another one bites the dust Oh, why can I not conquer love? And I might have thought that we were one Wanted to fight this war without weapons And I wanted it, I wanted it bad But there were so many red flags Now another one bites the dust Yeah, let's be clear I'll trust no one You did not break me I'm still fighting for peace I've got thick skin and an elastic heart But your blade it might be too sharp I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard I may snap and I move fast But you won't see me fall apart Cos I've got an elastic heart I've got an elastic heart Yeah, I've got an elastic heart And I will stay up through the night Let's be clear won't close my eyes And I know that I can survive I'll walk through fire to save my life And I want it, I want my life so bad I'm doing everything I can Then another one bites the dust It's hard to lose a chosen one You did not break me I'm still fighting for peace I've got thick skin and an elastic heart But your blade it might be too sharp I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard I may snap and I move fast But you won't see me fall apart Cos I've got an elastic heart`,
    `And now I know relationship's my enemy So stay away from me I'm warning you You try to fill the void with every man you meet 'Cause you're upset with me I'm warning you 'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes And all the nights you thought about takin' your life 'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight I don't wanna hurt you, oh I don't wanna hurt you I don't wanna hurt you, oh I don't wanna hurt you When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me Just call me up again I'll make you weak Girl, I'll come and put myself between your lips Not between your heart Can't you see?

    `I was distracted And in traffic I didn't feel it When the earthquake happened But it really got me thinkin' Were you out drinkin'? Were you in the living room Chillin' watchin' television? It's been a year now Think I've figured out how How to let you go and let communication die out I know, you know, we know You weren't down for forever and it's fine I know, you know, we know We weren't meant for each other and it's fine But if the world was ending You'd come over, right? You'd come over and you'd stay the night Would you love me for the hell of it? All our fears would be irrelevant If the world was ending You'd come over, right? The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight And there wouldn't be a reason why We would even have to say goodbye If the world was ending You'd come over, right? Right? If the world was ending You'd come over, right? Right? I tried to imagine Your reaction It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened But it really got me thinkin' That night we went drinkin' Stumbled in the house And didn't make it past the kitchen Ah, it's been a year now Think I've figured out how How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out`,
